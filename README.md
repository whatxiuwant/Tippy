Tippy is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Asika Dangol

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Not sure of how to fix the display sizing. The main view of the app does not stretch to both ends as programmer sees in XCode: http://imgur.com/gh7jo10 Had difficulties tying the Settings push action to the Settings View Controller. Whenever I clicked on it in my simulations it would not open the settings page even though there was a reference.
